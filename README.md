# TVLoaderLethalTVManager
Combines these two mods: 
- [TVLoader](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Rattenbonkers/TVLoader/)
- [LethalTVManager](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Bushwacc/LethalTVManager/)
## Features Config Options
- Uses Television Videos folder (TVLoader) instead of media (LethalTVManager)
- Aspect ratio options
- TV Always On.
- Videos play sequentially (TVLoader)
- Scan, volume, and skipping videos (LethalTVManager) with ability to hide the prompts
- Turn off and back on to skip (TVLoader)
I recommend to use [LethalConfig](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/AinaVT/LethalConfig/) to be able to adjust these options in game. 

Code is really messy because I just combined the two mods. Lot's of stuff to get rid of and improve about this.
