Welcome to Bestest TV Mod, a fusion of two popular mods:

## Recommendations

For convenient in-game adjustments, I recommend using [LethalConfig](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/AinaVT/LethalConfig/). This tool allows you to tweak config options without leaving the game environment.

If you want to scale the TV size as well, consider installing [ScaleableTelevision](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/DeathWrench/ScaleableTelevision/), which provides additional customization options for TV dimensions.

For downloading YouTube videos directly into your "Television Videos" folder, check out [YoutubeDownloader](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/DeathWrench/YoutubeDownloader/).

## Note

The automatic relocation of .mp4 files into the correct folder, previously facilitated by [Television Videos Fix](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/DeathWrench/TelevisionVideosFix/), is no longer required, though you can still use it.
