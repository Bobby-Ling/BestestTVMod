# Bestest TV Mod
I just combined these two mods:  
- [TVLoader](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Rattenbonkers/TVLoader/)
- [LethalTVManager](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Bushwacc/LethalTVManager/)
~~Lot's of stuff to get rid of and improve about this code~~ 
#### Most bugs have now been fixed. 
## Features and config options
- Uses "Television Videos" folder (TVLoader) instead of "media" (LethalTVManager)
- Aspect ratio options
- TV Always On.
- Videos play sequentially (TVLoader)
- Scan, volume, and skipping videos (LethalTVManager) with ability to hide the prompts
- Turn off and back on to skip (TVLoader)
## I recommend to use [LethalConfig](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/AinaVT/LethalConfig/) to be able to adjust these options in game. 
## If you want to scale the TV as well: [ScaleableTelevision](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/DeathWrench/ScaleableTelevision/)
~~This will automatically move .mp4's into the correct folder: [Television Videos Fix](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/DeathWrench/TelevisionVideosFix/)~~ 
#### No longer required.
