# Bestest TV Mod

Welcome to Bestest TV Mod, a fusion of two popular mods:
- [TVLoader](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Rattenbonkers/TVLoader/)
- [LethalTVManager](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Bushwacc/LethalTVManager/)

## Overview

Bestest TV Mod enhances your in-game television experience by combining the best features of TVLoader and LethalTVManager. With numerous improvements and bug fixes, this mod provides a seamless and customizable TV viewing experience for players.

## Features and Config Options

- **Folder Utilization**: Utilizes the "Television Videos" folder (TVLoader) instead of "media" (LethalTVManager) for easier video management.
- **Aspect Ratio Options**: Choose from various aspect ratio settings to suit your preference.
- **TV Always On**: Keep the TV running continuously without manual re-activation.
- **Sequential Video Playback**: Videos play in sequence for a more immersive viewing experience.
- **Shuffle Videos**: Load videos in a random order instead of alphabetically.
- **Custom Keybinds**: Set custom keybinds for scanning, skipping, seeking, and reloading videos.
- **Turn Off and On to Skip**: Easily skip to the next video by turning off and back on the TV. (TVLoader)
- **Seeking and Channel Controls**: Enable seeking with brackets and skip videos using comma or period keys. (LethalTVManager)
- **Mouse Wheel Volume Control**: Control the volume using the mouse wheel. (LethalTVManager)
- **Hide Hovertips**: Hide the controls when hovering over the TV for a cleaner interface.
- **Restrict Channels**: Disable the channel controls while keeping the UI visible, unless Hide Hovertips is also checked.

## Recommendations

For convenient in-game adjustments, I recommend using [LethalConfig](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/AinaVT/LethalConfig/). This tool allows you to tweak various options according to your preferences without leaving the game environment.

If you want to scale the TV size as well, consider installing [ScaleableTelevision](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/DeathWrench/ScaleableTelevision/), which provides additional customization options for TV dimensions.

## Additional Tools

For downloading YouTube videos directly into your "Television Videos" folder, check out [YoutubeDownloader](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/DeathWrench/YoutubeDownloader/).

## Note

The automatic relocation of .mp4 files into the correct folder, previously facilitated by [Television Videos Fix](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/DeathWrench/TelevisionVideosFix/), is no longer required, though you can still use it.
